# 1.Relationship Between "Product" and "Product_Category" Entities:

In the context of a relational database, the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities is likely established through a foreign key relationship. This relationship is based on the "category_id" column in the "Product" table, which is likely a foreign key referencing the "id" column in the "Product_Category" table.

## Explanation:

-   The "category_id" column in the "Product" table acts as a foreign key that establishes a link between the two tables.
-   For each product in the "Product" table, the "category_id" value corresponds to the "id" value of a specific category in the "Product_Category" table.
-   This relationship allows you to associate each product with a specific category, providing a way to organize and categorize products.

# 2.Ensuring Each Product Has a Valid Category:

To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can use a foreign key constraint. A foreign key constraint ensures that the values in the "category_id" column of the "Product" table must exist in the "id" column of the "Product_Category" table.

## Steps:

1. When defining the "Product" table, you declare a foreign key constraint on the "category_id" column, referencing the "id" column in the "Product_Category" table.
2. This constraint ensures that any value entered into the "category_id" column of the "Product" table must match an existing "id" value in the "Product_Category" table.
